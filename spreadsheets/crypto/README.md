Spreadsheets for cryptocurrency tracking

## Crypto Tracking vXXX
Little spreadsheet I wrote to track cryptocurrency transactions and related capital gains, income, etc.

Spreadsheet includes realtime quotes using the CoinMarketCap API. In order to use this functionality, you will need to create an account [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) and apply for a free API key. Paste the key in the shaded cell on the "config" tab. You will get error messages upon opening the spreadsheet and using the refresh buttons until you have input the API key.

Disclaimers:

- This spreadsheet is in .xlsm format and contains VBA code / macros. The code merely automates the updates for the market prices and refreshes the pivot tables. These functions will not work unless you enable macros upon opening the document. YOU SHOULD ALWAYS REVIEW VBA CODE FOR MACRO ENABLED DOCUMENTS DOWNLOADED FROM THE INTERNET - DO NOT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT AND REVIEW THE CODE YOURSELF FIRST!

- I am not a crypto tax expert and proper reporting of tax obligations is the responsibility of you and your tax preparer.

- This spreadsheet is a work in progress and errors may exist - if you discover any, please report back to me and I'll be happy to investigate.

- Designed in the latest build of Excel 365. I cannot vouch that it will work on any previous versions.
